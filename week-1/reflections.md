#1.1 Think About Time

This was a fun exercise for me as I’ve had some experience with several of the concepts mentioned. I was really intrigued by the Fogg Method for its focus on habitual change and improvement. It reminded me of [a great Radiolab episode](http://www.radiolab.org/story/117291-you-v-you/) about how sometimes we get in our own way.

Since I can remember, I’ve been a procrastinator and perfectionist. Early on I developed organizational skills and systems for myself as coping mechanisms (scheduling, lists, color coding, sticky notes on the bathroom mirror - you name it). In school I used to make external commitments to my friends about deadlines. If I had a paper due I would pledge to my best friend that the rough draft would be done by Wednesday day or else I owed her laps after school (I **HATE** to run…) - that worked.

One of my old bosses introduced me to timeboxing and I timeboxed in fixed increments set for repetitive tasks (more like the Pomodoro technique). But as my work has changed and evolved to be more creative I find this kind of timeboxing feels more difficult. I have a hard time estimating how long something should take if I don’t really know how I’m going to solve a problem. I think this is a sign that I'm not doing enough reflection and tracking. I think this is still a successful strategy for me so I plan to re-focus my timeboxing efforts by really tracking my time with a REAL LIFE TIMER and also adhering to a stricter schedule. All this research has really reminded me that I’m better in the evenings than the mornings and should honor that fact.

My plan for DBC is three fold:

* Variable length timeboxing in a fixed schedule
  * I'm a night owl with a newly purchased kitchen timer. It's on.
* Shut down the distractions
  * Thanks to an episode of one of my favorite podcasts, [Note to Self](http://www.wnyc.org/story/how-can-we-stop-trading-attention-profit/), I’m inspired to find the right app for my computer and phone to shut down all distractions (email, text, calls, calendar notifications) when I’m in work mode. If anyone has a suggestion for an app or settings they like - let me know!
* Trello to manage it all
  *List-o-philes should definitely try [Trello](https://trello.com/home) - it’s free and amazing. My favorite way to keep track of all the crap I want to get done.

#1.2 The Command Line

**What is a shell? What is “bash?"**

The shell is very scary deep dark hole that I wish I hadn’t found. Just kidding! The shell is cool - it’s a blank slate where our command lines live and through which we powerful programmers can control our computers! Well so far I can only move things around and print them out and stuff… but we’re getting there! Thanks Shell! Bash is Shell’s best pal! Bash is the only one that can really talk to Shell. Ya know? Thy understand each other. Technically - bash is the language that the shell interprets.


**What was the most challenging for you in going through this material?**

The most challenging thing for me was getting started. I was really tempted to ask all my questions of my coworkers on the development team to get some fast answers to blast through my confusion. But I’m happy I just stuck with it and got through my confusion on my own. Finding the answers in my own research and trying out my ideas in the shell was really rewarding.


**Were you able to successfully use all of the commands?**

Indeed I am so happy (and relieved) to say that I got all the commands to work. It was a little touch and go there when attempting to move those text files from my desktop to the temp directory - but after a fabulous walk and a latte - I moved those files!


**In your opinion, what are the most important commands and arguments to know?**

I think the most important thing we learned in this exercise is how to get around and how to answer our own questions. So with that in mind, I love all the “helpful” commands - like man and pwd and ls.


**Can you remember what each of the following does off the top of your head? Write what each does.**

- pwd - print working directory (lets you know where you are)
- ls - list contents of the current directory
- mv - move a file or directory (actually just renames it)
- cd - change directories (move up and down in your current stack of directories)
- ../ - when cd precedes it - move up one level in your current stack (or mush these babies together to move up several steps in one line)
- touch - creates a new (empty) field
- mkdir - make a new directory
- less - shows you the contents of a files (one page at a time)
- rmdir - remove a directory
- rm - removed a file
- help - shows you a list of available commands
