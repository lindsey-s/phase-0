<!--
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
I find HTML eerily easy to conceptualize and write. This is overall very exciting - because suddenly I could just write website after website! But it's also got me a bit jittery. Of course there's more to know than I currently do and it's by no means second nature, but the pleasant surprise feeling has me thinking I'm missing something big. I think a little more studying will ease my mind.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
This was also quite easy because there are so many online resources to draw upon. I also realized what a rich resource we are to one another - my pair was extremely helpful! In the end - I'm also glad we did a bit of reading up on how to google in week 1 :)

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
I think I did well - I was tempted to do a table to get the links formatted a bit more like they appear on the website but I'm not tempted to do much formatting in HTML in general. I'm too excited to CSS to start!

- What seems good and bad about HTML?
I think HTML is good for formatting! Just kidding ;)
I think what's good is that it's so simple - I'm loving that. What's bad is that it seems annoying or inconvenient to me right now to have to sort of "nest" other languages into the HTML skeleton to really build out a website. So I suppose it seems like a sort of limited or inflexible language right now. I'm looking forward to knowing more about CSS soon, though, and am keeping an open mind about HTML in the meantime.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
I'm loving how in Sublime it prompts you to add the tag if you start typing one and places your cursor in-between those tags so you can start typing content! I'm also loving the multiple cursor feature in Sublime so you can easily update multiple lines. I realize these are both just Sublime tricks to help me write HTML but not remember HOW to write HTML - I honestly just have the required tags memorized at this point and am referring to that Skillcrush cheat-sheet when I need to.
