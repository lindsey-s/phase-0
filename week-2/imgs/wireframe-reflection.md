###What is a wireframe?
A wireframe is a mach-up of the layout of a website. It focuses on the hierarchy of information you wish to present and an be as simple as a sketch!

###What are the benefits of wireframing?
Wireframing allows you to focus solely on things like information and user flow, content importance and prioritization and even funtionality (i.e. button behaviors) without the distraction of putting forward choices on other design elements such as color, imagery, etc.

###Did you enjoy wireframing your site?
Yes and no - I think I let myself get a little annoyed that it wasn't perfect even though of course that's not quite the point. It was more difficult than I thought it would be to focus on information and UX principles - I was so tempted to think about the smaller graphic design choices like color and imagery.

###Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?
I ended up sticking with my first sketches. I think in large part because they were more accurately pointing to the relevant information for the target audience.

###What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?
I think I did pretty well with just the resources contained in this assignment (2.4) and the week 2 videos on [Design Stuff](https://talks.devbootcamp.com/design-stuffs-1).

###Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?
I enjoyed playing around with things spatially and thinking about headers, body and content with a basic background in HTML.
