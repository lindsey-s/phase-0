    <p>
      Welcome new and aspirational programmers to the wonderful concept of version control! My name is Lindsey Stevenson and I’m also quite new to programming myself. This blog will cover version control as a principle, using git as your version control system, and using GitHub to store your code.

    <h2>Version Control</h2>
    <p>
      Version control is simply the idea of managing different versions of your project. It really is just what is sounds like. This main concept is applicable to all sorts of projects (think graphic design, research paper, photo editing, and of course, software development) and if you’ve ever saved a draft of something and continued working on another copy you’ve already used version control without the help of a bona fide system like git (we'll get to git in a moment).
    </p>
    <p>
      Version control keeps a “master" copy of your project in a safe place while you work on changes locally. When your changes are ready to go - you send them over the master and it is version control that allows you to clearly see what’s being updated (deleted, added, etc) and merge those changes into the master. This simple explanation highlights two of the greatest benefits of version control: the ability to to easily revert to a specific draft if you discover you’ve made a mistake and the ability to easily merge changes back to the master.

    <p>
        Now that version control is clear we can easily <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grok">grok</a> that git is a full-fledged version control system (VCS) and GitHub is a free and open-source platform for collaboration and storage that uses git as its VCS. Git is one of many version control systems out there (CVS and SVN are two others - <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2008/09/the-top-7-open-source-version-control-systems/">check out this blog</a> to see 7 reviewed) and GitHub is one of many platforms for managing and storing your projects and code. Check out a few key differences between GitHub and <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">BitBucket</a> in this <a href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/love-github-4-reasons-why-you-should-host-your-code-on-bitbucket/">post</a>.

        Git helps you keep track of changes because it stores any and everything to save (commit) with a unique key that allows you to later view that version. It’s quite technical - and I don’t fully understand how it works. The best explanation for <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Plumbing-and-Porcelain">how git works</a> that I’ve come across is the fabulous and free online book <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2">Pro Git</a> by Scott Chacon and Ben Straub. But to be honest, the best way to understand how it helps you keep track of changes is to start using it. Attempting to fully understand the nitty gritty processes at this stage is more difficult and slower than just getting down to it and using git and GitHub. Storing your projects and code on GitHub, making changes on your local machine and merging those changes back to the master file on GitHub will allow you to experience the power of version control first hand. After all, learning the git commands is learning to code and since that's what you aim to do - start doing it! Git along little coder!

    <h2>Join In!</h2>
    <p>
        GitHub is a teeming community of developers at all levels. Keeping your code on GitHub communicates to the world wide web that you are here to contribute and discuss. It’s collaboration in its purest (and maybe most modern) form. And that can be an intimidating idea. The barrier to entry may seem quite high at this moment. But the very thing that is most intimidating is also the most empowering: the open source nature of GitHub means that there isn’t a problem you’re having that someone else hasn’t already had. And this robust and open community is all about sharing their triumphs, tribulations and solutions. You really can find the answer and scale that entry barrier. This is a community worth joining!
